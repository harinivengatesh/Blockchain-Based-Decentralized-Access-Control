# Blockchain-Based-Decentralized-Access-Control
We'll build a REST API backend with simulated blockchain logic to manage user registration, access granting, and access requests. Each action will be recorded as a "block" with timestamps and hashes in an in-memory array. A simple HTML+JS frontend will interact with the backend to demonstrate the system.
